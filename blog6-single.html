      <p>K. T. Manu was a renowned scholar, famous writer, and eloquent speaker in the state of Kerala. He was the head of an educational institution, particularly dedicated to girls' education, and devoted much effort to building educational networks and contributing to social and religious matters until his passing.
        <br>
        <br>
        He was born in the village of Karavarakundu in Malappuram district in 1932. His father passed away when he was young, leaving him impoverished and orphaned. Due to this, he did not receive formal schooling beyond the fourth grade and continued his education through mosque classes, eventually graduating from Bakiyat al-Salihat College.
        <br>
        <br>
        He became the guardian of orphans and established an orphanage after his teaching career. He was the pioneer of the education revolution, founding Dar al-Najat, which laid the foundation for numerous educational institutions in the Karavarakundu hills area, including arts and science colleges, an Arabic college, and a Sharia college. He also contributed to the establishment of orphanages for girls and their education.
        <br>
        <br>
        His tenure on the Education Council of the All Kerala Ulama Association was marked by numerous initiatives related to education. He tirelessly worked to develop and enhance schools throughout Kerala, leading to their widespread recognition. He made significant efforts to develop both religious and secular education over time and was involved in formulating educational curricula.
        <br>
        <br>
        His character was characterized by humility, piety, and detachment from worldly affairs, akin to the lives of elders and scholars. Once, he traveled to the Gulf region to secure financial support for his institution, walking through Dubai wearing worn-out sandals. When his companion suggested buying new sandals as his were almost broken, he replied modestly that they were there for an important purpose, not for shopping.
        <br>
        <br>
        His life was dedicated to serving the community, educational institutions, and student development until his passing. He died of a heart attack in 2009 during the silver jubilee celebration of the All Kerala Ulama Association in Calicut and was buried in the compound of his institution, Dar al-Najat. May Allah elevate his status - Amen.</p>
